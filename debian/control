Suggests: tcpdump
Description: intuitive network emulator that interacts with real nets (metapackage)
 The Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) is a tool for emulating
 networks in one or more machines. You can connect these emulated
 networks to live networks.
 .
 CORE consists of a GUI for drawing topologies of lightweight virtual
 machines, and Python modules for scripting network emulation.
 .
 Key features:
 .
   1. Network lab in a box
        - Efficient and scalable
        - Easy-to-use GUI canvas
        - Centralized configuration and control
   2. Runs applications and protocols without modifying them
   3. Real-time connection to live networks
        - Hardware-in-the-loop
        - Distributed with multiple COREs
   4. Highly customizable
   5. The emulated machines can use several resources and programs
      installed on the real machine, as tcpdump.
 .
 This is a metapackage depending on the packages for the CORE daemon and GUI.
