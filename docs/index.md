# CORE Documentation

## Introduction

CORE (Common Open Research Emulator) is a tool for building virtual networks. As an emulator, CORE builds a
representation of a real computer network that runs in real time, as opposed to simulation, where abstract models are
used. The live-running emulation can be connected to physical networks and routers. It provides an environment for
running real applications and protocols, taking advantage of tools provided by the Linux operating system.

CORE is typically used for network and protocol research, demonstrations, application and platform testing, evaluating
networking scenarios, security studies, and increasing the size of physical test networks.
