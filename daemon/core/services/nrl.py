### Basic configuration ###
###########################
# keep this settings at the beginning of your first configuration file

# Debug level (0-9)
# If set to 0 the daemon runs in the background, unless "NoFork" is set to true
# (Default is 1)

# DebugLevel  1

# IP version to use (4 or 6)
# (Default is 4)

# IpVersion 4

### OLSRd agent configuration ###
#################################
# this parameters control the settings of the routing agent which are not
# related to the OLSR protocol and it's extensions

# FIBMetric controls the metric value of the host-routes OLSRd sets.
# - "flat" means that the metric value is always 2. This is the preferred value
#   because it helps the linux kernel routing to clean up older routes
# - "correct" use the hopcount as the metric value.
# - "approx" use the hopcount as the metric value too, but does only update the
#   hopcount if the nexthop changes too
# (Default is "flat")

# FIBMetric "flat"

#######################################
### Linux specific OLSRd extensions ###
#######################################
# these parameters are only working on linux at the moment

# SrcIpRoutes tells OLSRd to set the Src flag of host routes to the originator-ip
# of the node. In addition to this an additional localhost device is created
# to make sure the returning traffic can be received.
# (Default is "no")

# SrcIpRoutes no

# Specify the proto tag to be used for routes olsr inserts into kernel
# currently only implemented for linux
# valid values under linux are 1 .. 254
# 1 gets remapped by olsrd to 0 UNSPECIFIED (1 is reserved for ICMP redirects)
# 2 KERNEL routes (not very wise to use)
# 3 BOOT (should in fact not be used by routing daemons)
# 4 STATIC
# 8 .. 15 various routing daemons (gated, zebra, bird, & co)
# (defaults to 0 which gets replaced by an OS-specific default value
# under linux 3 (BOOT) (for backward compatibility)

# RtProto 0

# Activates (in IPv6 mode) the automatic use of NIIT
# (see README-Olsr-Extensions)
# (default is "yes")

# UseNiit yes

# Activates the smartgateway ipip tunnel feature.
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smartgateways.
# (default is "no")

# SmartGateway no

# Signals that the server tunnel must always be removed on shutdown,
# irrespective of the interface up/down state during startup.
# (default is "no")

# SmartGatewayAlwaysRemoveServerTunnel no

# Determines the maximum number of gateways that can be in use at any given
# time. This setting is used to mitigate the effects of breaking connections
# (due to the selection of a new gateway) on a dynamic network.
# (default is 1)

# SmartGatewayUseCount 1

# Determines the take-down percentage for a non-current smart gateway tunnel.
# If the cost of the current smart gateway tunnel is less than this percentage
# of the cost of the non-current smart gateway tunnel, then the non-current smart
# gateway tunnel is taken down because it is then presumed to be 'too expensive'.
# This setting is only relevant when SmartGatewayUseCount is larger than 1;
# a value of 0 will result in the tunnels not being taken down proactively.
# (default is 0)

# SmartGatewayTakeDownPercentage 0

# Determines the policy routing script that is executed during startup and
# shutdown of olsrd. The script is only executed when SmartGatewayUseCount
# is set to a value larger than 1. The script must setup policy routing
# rules such that multi-gateway mode works. A sample script is included.
# (default is not set)

# SmartGatewayPolicyRoutingScript ""

# Determines the egress interfaces that are part of the multi-gateway setup and
# therefore only relevant when SmartGatewayUseCount is larger than 1 (in which
# case it must be explicitly set).
# (default is not set)

# SmartGatewayEgressInterfaces ""

# Determines the routing tables offset for multi-gateway policy routing tables
# See the policy routing script for an explanation.
# (default is 90)

# SmartGatewayTablesOffset 90

# Determines the policy routing rules offset for multi-gateway policy routing
# rules. See the policy routing script for an explanation.
# (default is 0, which indicates that the rules and tables should be aligned and
# puts this value at SmartGatewayTablesOffset - # egress interfaces -
# # olsr interfaces)

# SmartGatewayRulesOffset 87

# Allows the selection of a smartgateway with NAT (only for IPv4)
# (default is "yes")

# SmartGatewayAllowNAT yes

# Determines the period (in milliseconds) on which a new smart gateway
# selection is performed.
# (default is 10000 milliseconds)

# SmartGatewayPeriod 10000

# Determines the number of times the link state database must be stable
# before a new smart gateway is selected.
# (default is 6)

# SmartGatewayStableCount 6

# When another gateway than the current one has a cost of less than the cost
# of the current gateway multiplied by SmartGatewayThreshold then the smart
# gateway is switched to the other gateway. The unit is percentage.
# (defaults to 0)

# SmartGatewayThreshold 0

# The weighing factor for the gateway uplink bandwidth (exit link, uplink).
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smart gateways.
# (default is 1)

# SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkUp 1

# The weighing factor for the gateway downlink bandwidth (exit link, downlink).
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smart gateways.
# (default is 1)

# SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkDown 1

# The weighing factor for the ETX costs.
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smart gateways.
# (default is 1)

# SmartGatewayWeightEtx 1

# The divider for the ETX costs.
# See README-Olsr-Extensions for a description of smart gateways.
# (default is 0)

# SmartGatewayDividerEtx 0

# Defines what kind of Uplink this node will publish as a
# smartgateway. The existence of the uplink is detected by
# a route to 0.0.0.0/0, ::ffff:0:0/96 and/or 2000::/3.
# possible values are "none", "ipv4", "ipv6", "both"
# (default is "both")

# SmartGatewayUplink "both"

# Specifies if the local ipv4 uplink use NAT
# (default is "yes")

# SmartGatewayUplinkNAT yes

# Specifies the speed of the uplink in kilobit/s.
# First parameter is upstream, second parameter is downstream
# (default is 128/1024)

# SmartGatewaySpeed 128 1024

# Specifies the EXTERNAL ipv6 prefix of the uplink. A prefix
